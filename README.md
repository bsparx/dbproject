Quiz Craft
A robust backend system built with Prisma and designed for efficient data handling, user validation, and seamless integration with OpenAI's LangChain. This repository provides a scalable foundation for managing SQL queries, optimizing database connections, and enhancing user validation workflows.

Features
Efficient CRUD Operations: Centralized in Crud.ts for fetching, updating, reading, and deleting data.
AI-Powered Queries: Ai.ts integrates with LangChain to generate structured JSON responses from ChatGPT queries, which can be parsed and stored efficiently.
Optimized Database Handling: db.ts extends Prisma's functionality to reuse database connections with Neon, minimizing overhead and improving performance.
User Management: User.ts handles user-related queries, while validation.ts ensures robust user data validation.
Folder Structure
utils/
The utils folder contains the core backend logic and utilities:

Crud.ts:
Centralized file for all SQL queries related to CRUD operations. This file acts as the backbone for interacting with the database.

Ai.ts:
Handles AI integration using LangChain. This enables the architecture of queries to ChatGPT and returns structured JSON data.

Parses and stores JSON outputs for further processing.
db.ts:
Extends the Prisma variable to optimize database connections, especially with Neon, ensuring a single connection is reused across queries rather than creating new connections repeatedly.

User.ts:
Contains logic for user-related queries, such as fetching or updating user data.

validation.ts:
Includes robust validation functions to ensure all user data adheres to expected formats and constraints.

Prerequisites
Node.js v16+
Prisma
A Neon database instance
Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Set up environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory and configure your database URL and any necessary API keys (e.g., for LangChain).

Example .env:

env
Copy code
DATABASE_URL=your-neon-database-url
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
Run database migrations:

bash
Copy code
npx prisma migrate dev
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Usage
CRUD Operations: Use Crud.ts to handle database interactions for all data-related operations.
AI-Powered Queries: Utilize Ai.ts to generate and parse ChatGPT queries tailored to your application needs.
Database Connections: db.ts ensures persistent and efficient connections to the Neon database.
User Validation: Use User.ts and validation.ts for secure and consistent user data management.
